## C++ Identifiers
All <strong>variables</strong> declared in a C++ code file must be having <strong>unique names</strong>. These unique names are called <strong>identifers</strong>.<br>
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, weight, height).<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:
```cpp
int speed = 40;
int s = 40;
/*
Here it is quite hard for a programmer to understand what the variable s is for in code.
*/
```
Generally, there are some rules for writing identifiers in C++:
<ul>
    <li>Names can contain letters, digits and underscores</li>
    <li>Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)</li>
    <li>Names are case sensitive (<em>myVar</em> and <em>myvar</em> are different variables)</li>
    <li>Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.</li>
    <li>Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as <em>int</em>) cannot be used as names</li>
</ul>
